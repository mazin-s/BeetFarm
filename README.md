# Dwight's BeetFarm (Comp 110 Project)

Instructions
In our beet farm game, every day you can chose to take one of three different actions - water your beets, spray them with bear repellant, or harvest them and end the game. Every day that your beets stay alive, the number of beets you have grows, but if they get too thirsty, are over-watered, or don't have enough bear repellant, they will all die and you go home with no beets for all your hard work. Try to grow as many beets as you can before deciding to harvest them.
